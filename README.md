## Setup
If you have nix installed, there are included derivations for a gcc compiler and binutils configued to target the correct architecture for the included makefiles

If not, you can get the i386-elf toolchain required by visiting https://github.com/nativeos/i386-elf-toolchain and downloading the correct release for your build OS

## Running
TBD... I plan to refactor the directory structure and then provide nix apps to automatically run the machine problems
